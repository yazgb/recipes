Ingredients:

 - 1 can sweetened condensed milk (14 oz)
 - 1 can evaporated milk (12 oz)
 - 1 cup fresh lime juice (I used 18 key limes)
 - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
 - 2 packs Maria cookies, 7 ounces each (24 cookies per pack)
 - Fresh fruit: raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, whatever you like
 - Whipped cream for topping
 

Directions:

 1. In the blender, add the condensed milk, evaporated milk, lime juice and vanilla. Blend on high until smooth and doubles in volume.

 2. Line pan of choice with parchment paper. I used a 9-inch round spring-form pan. Begin with a light layer of lime/milk filling on the bottom. Just enough to cover. Add a layer of cookies. Continue layering until you run out of ingredients. After the third or fourth layer, I added a light layer of fresh fruit (sliced thin), then continued layering. Your last layer should end with the filling, not cookies.

 3. Once done, top the pie with desired fruit and chill for at least 6 hours or overnight. When ready to serve, if using spring-form pan, use a knife to release the edges of pie from pan before unlocking the pan. Place on serving platter and slice desired pieces. Serve with whipped cream if you like.
